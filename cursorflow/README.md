# CursorFlow - Optimized Interactive Experience

A highly optimized, interactive web experience featuring beautiful cursor effects, immersive audio feedback, and smooth 60fps performance.

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

This project has been extensively optimized for maximum performance and efficiency:

### React Optimizations
- **React.memo** for component memoization
- **useMemo** for expensive calculations
- **useCallback** for stable function references
- **Lazy loading** for code splitting
- **Object pooling** for audio nodes

### Rendering Optimizations
- **Canvas rendering** with 60fps throttling
- **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth animations
- **Throttled mouse events** for better performance
- **Optimized particle systems** with object reuse

### Audio Optimizations
- **Audio node pooling** to reduce garbage collection
- **Pre-defined audio configurations** to minimize object creation
- **Throttled audio triggers** for better performance
- **Memory-efficient audio context management**

### Build Optimizations
- **Code splitting** with manual chunks
- **Tree shaking** for unused code elimination
- **Minification** with console removal
- **Optimized bundle naming** for better caching

## 🎯 Features

```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:

```typescript
import { usePerformanceMonitor } from './utils/performanceUtils';

const { recordMetric, startMeasure, endMeasure, logReport } = usePerformanceMonitor();

// Monitor specific operations
startMeasure('expensiveOperation');
// ... your code ...
endMeasure('expensiveOperation');

// Log performance report
logReport();
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Move your mouse** to see beautiful cursor trails and particles
2. **Click anywhere** to hear immersive audio feedback
3. **Move vertically** to control melody pitch
4. **Move horizontally** to control drum BPM
5. **Use the control buttons** in the top-right to toggle features

## 🔧 Configuration

### Audio Settings
- Toggle audio on/off with the volume button
- Audio automatically initializes on first user interaction
- Supports Web Audio API with fallbacks

### Visual Settings
- Toggle effects on/off with the eye button
- Effects include trails, particles, and ambient visuals
- Optimized for smooth performance

## 📈 Performance Metrics

The application is optimized for:
- **60fps** smooth animations
- **< 100ms** audio latency
- **< 1MB** initial bundle size
- **< 50MB** memory usage
- **< 100ms** first contentful paint

### Optimization Techniques Used
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse expensive objects (audio nodes, particles)
- **Throttling**: Limit expensive operations (mouse events, audio triggers)
- **Memoization**: Cache expensive calculations and components
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed
- **Code Splitting**: Separate vendor and feature code
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks with proper cleanup

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
1. Check browser console for performance warnings
2. Use `npm run performance` to analyze build
3. Monitor memory usage in browser dev tools
4. Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled

### Audio Issues
1. Check browser audio permissions
2. Ensure user has interacted with the page
3. Check browser console for audio errors
4. Try refreshing the page
